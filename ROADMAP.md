# Haruko Battlesnake — Development Roadmap

> Active development plan. Completed iterations are archived in [ROADMAP_FINISHED.md](ROADMAP_FINISHED.md).
> Each iteration: implement → test → snapshot → compare → merge → move to finished → update ENGINE.md.
> Development follows a data-driven loop: trace games → analyze outcomes → identify root causes → design targeted fixes → verify with A/B comparison.

## Current State

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Completed** | Iterations 1-20, 23-28 (see ROADMAP_FINISHED.md) |
| **Dead ends** | Iter 21 (positional quality), Iter 22 (aggression), Iter 27 partial (full isSafeDir pruning: 32%), Iter 28 partial (tail-aware BRS pruning: 43%), Iter 29 (hybrid BRS+MCTS: 2–46%) |
| **Next** | TBD — analyze v28 game traces to identify next lever |
| **Current** | v28 Tail-aware isSafeDir; 61% vs v27 (N=100); ~436 avg turns |
| **Key insight** | MCTS is not viable for this engine — BRS depth is hypersensitive to budget and MCTS random sampling produces wrong preferences against optimal play. Eval quality and search depth remain the only levers. |

## Iter 29 — Hybrid BRS+MCTS Root-Level Vote (Dead End)

**Status:** ❌ DEAD END — 2–46% across 6 configurations

**What was tried:**
- Flat depth-1 MCTS (UCB1 selection, random opponent, xorshift64 PRNG, ~52K sims/50ms)
- Sequential budget splits: 70/30 (2%), 95/5 (30% — pure budget loss)
- Tiebreaker-only: MCTS breaks exact BRS score ties (46%)
- Concurrent goroutines: data race on gameSimPool

**Why it failed:**
1. BRS depth is hypersensitive to budget — even 5% (15ms) reduction causes measurable depth regression
2. Depth-1 MCTS with random opponents systematically favors moves good against weak play
3. Even as tiebreaker on exact BRS ties, MCTS noise hurts (46%)
4. Concurrent BRS+MCTS blocked by data races on shared sync.Pool

**Infrastructure retained:** `BRSResult`, `bestMoveBRS()`, `mctsSearch()`, `logic/mcts.go`

## Next Steps

Candidate directions for future iterations:

**Late-game survival signals:**
Space-to-length ratio, partition food planning, opponent space crisis.

**Further phase-gating:**
Other eval signals that could be skipped/simplified in early game for more depth.
