# Claude context — haruko

Battlesnake AI in Go. Module: `github.com/bodist/haruko`. Server port: 8080.

## Key files
- `main.go` — `info/start/end/move` handlers, `GameSession` map (mutex-protected with `sync.RWMutex`)
- `logic/sim.go` — `GameSim`: full game state simulator with `Clone`, `CloneFromPool`/`Release`, `Step(MoveSet)`, `MoveSnakes(MoveSet)`, `IsOver`
- `logic/eval.go` — `Evaluate(g, myIdx int)`: composite eval (Voronoi territory + length advantage + h2h pressure + opponent confinement + food urgency)
- `logic/voronoi.go` — `VoronoiResult` struct + `VoronoiTerritory(g, myIdx int) VoronoiResult`: multi-source BFS with territory, food ownership, partition detection (workspace pooled)
- `logic/search.go` — `BestMoveIterative(myID, budget)`: iterative deepening with time management; index-based BRS + paranoid minimax; all hot-path cloning via sync.Pool
- `logic/zobrist.go` — `GameSim.Hash()`: Zobrist hashing (snake bodies + food)
- `logic/tt.go` — `TranspositionTable`: probe/store with generation-based invalidation
- `logic/types.go` — shared types: `Coord`, `Snake`, `Direction`, `AllDirections`, `MaxSnakes`, `MoveSet`
- `logic/bench_test.go` — microbenchmarks for Clone, Step, Evaluate, Voronoi, BRS node
- `Makefile` — `make local` is the main dev loop (build → start server → 1v1 self-game → stop)

## Rules CLI (game engine)
Tracked as a project tool in `go.mod` (`tool github.com/BattlesnakeOfficial/rules/cli/battlesnake`).
Run via `go tool battlesnake` — no global install, nothing in `~/go/bin`, no `$PATH` changes.

**Policy: keep all tooling project-scoped.** Never suggest `go install` for dev tools — use `go get -tool` instead and invoke with `go tool <name>`.

## Type bridge (main.go)
API types (`Coord`, `Battlesnake` in `models.go`) are converted to `logic.Coord` / `logic.Snake` via `coordsToLogic()` and `snakesToLogic()` before being passed to `GameSim`. Keep this pattern when adding new logic-package functions — the logic package must not import main.

## Ports
- `:8080` — current snake (all normal targets)
- `:8081` — previous snapshot (`make compare`)

## Current state (Iter 16 — VoronoiResult infrastructure)
Rich Voronoi: `VoronoiResult` struct returns territory counts, food ownership (MyFood/OppFood), and partition detection (IsPartitioned) at zero extra cost (~1048ns/0 allocs). Eval uses territory only — food control and partition signals were tested but hurt or were neutral (see failed experiments). BRS node cost: ~1.1µs/0 allocs unchanged from Iter 14.

## Bench / version comparison
- `make bench [N=10]` — self-play; turns are the meaningful metric (A/B split is noise)
- `make snapshot` / `make compare PREV=... [N=50]` — version diff on :8080 vs :8081
- `-save FILE` flag writes JSONL: `{"n":1,"winner":"A","turns":42,"seed":123}` — seed replays exact game with `--seed`
- Speed: ~100 games in 4s with 16 workers; all local, no network overhead

Baselines (self-play avg turns): v1 ~68, v5 ~87, v6 ~328, v8 ~330, v9 ~306, v10 ~417, v11 ~197, v12 ~213, v13 ~200, v14 ~215.
`make bench` manages the server lifecycle automatically; `go run ./cmd/bench` requires a server already running on the target port.

**Note:** Paranoid minimax (retained in `BestMove`) degrades at depth 7+. BRS in `BestMoveIterative` breaks this ceiling.

**Next:** Game-phase eval (Iter 17), move ordering improvement (Iter 18).

**Roadmap rationale:** Every past win came from deeper search or better evaluation. Generic search pruning doesn't work at BRS's low BF. Constant-weight food signals are noise. The next lever is **game-phase-aware eval** — different weights for early/mid/late game — using VoronoiResult data (MyFood, IsPartitioned) shipped in Iter 16.

## Failed experiments (do NOT retry without new preconditions)

### Quiescence search at BRS leaves (Iter 13)
Tried wiring `qsMax`/`qsMin` into `brsMax`/`brsMin` depth-0 returns. Tested multiple configurations — all performed ≤50% vs Iter 12 baseline (N=100 each):

| Config | Win rate vs Iter 12 |
|--------|-------------------|
| qsMaxDepth=2, isQuiet dist≤2, safeMoves≤1 | 41% |
| qsMaxDepth=1, same triggers | 51% |
| qsMaxDepth=1, tight triggers (dist≤1, safeMoves==0) | 48% |
| qsMin: all 4 opp dirs when no forcing moves | 48% |
| Eval hardening only (no QS at all) | 45% |

**Root cause:** Clone+Step+Evaluate per QS node is too expensive relative to the 300ms budget. Each QS extension costs the same as a regular BRS ply, so QS steals depth from the main search. The tactical benefit of resolving horizon effects doesn't compensate for the lost main-search depth.

**Preconditions to retry:**
1. ~~Clone+Step must become significantly cheaper (sync.Pool, arena allocation, or bitboard sim) — Iter 14 perf work~~ **MET in Iter 14**: CloneFromPool 4.4x faster (19ns/0 allocs), Step 0 allocs. BRS node ~1.1µs total.
2. Or: QS must avoid Clone+Step entirely (incremental move/unmove on the same GameSim)
3. Or: Budget must increase well beyond 300ms (different game mode / hardware)

**What to keep:** The `isQuiet`, `forcingMoves`, `safeMoveCount` helpers are useful independent of QS — `safeMoveCount` is already used by `Evaluate()`.

### Search pruning/extensions — LMR, NMP, volatile extensions (Iter 15)
Tried three standard chess search techniques in BRS. Tested every combination (N=100 each vs Iter 14):

| Config | Win rate vs Iter 14 |
|--------|-------------------|
| All three (LMR + NMP + extensions) | ~48.5% (52%, 45%) |
| Extensions only | 42% |
| LMR only (index≥2) | 50% |
| LMR only (index≥3, less aggressive) | 47% |
| NMP only | 47% |
| LMR + NMP | 39% |

**Root cause — low branching factor:** BRS has only 4×4=16 nodes per full ply pair. Alpha-beta with TT+killers already prunes this efficiently. These techniques are designed for high-BF games (chess ~35, go ~250) where most moves are bad and you must prune aggressively to reach any depth. In BRS:
- **LMR:** With only 4 moves, reducing moves 2-3 means reducing 50% of all moves. They aren't "bad" — just not the predicted best. Information loss outweighs the tiny depth savings.
- **NMP:** "Skip our move" = play `Down` which may hit a wall/opponent. This isn't a true null move — it's a bad move. The concept of tempo doesn't translate to Battlesnake where every move is existential.
- **Extensions:** Extra ply in volatile positions costs 16+ nodes, stealing time from iterative deepening. Losing one full depth iteration everywhere is worse than gaining 1 ply in one branch.
- **LMR+NMP interact badly (39%):** NMP prunes based on reduced-depth LMR scores, compounding errors.

**Key insight: do NOT apply chess search pruning techniques to BRS.** The low branching factor means the search tree is already narrow. Future search improvements should focus on better evaluation or game-specific heuristics rather than generic tree pruning.

### Food control eval + partition short-circuit (Iter 16)
Enriched `VoronoiTerritory` to return `VoronoiResult` with food ownership and partition detection. Tried using this data in eval and search:

| Config | Win rate vs Iter 14 |
|--------|-------------------|
| Food control wt=3.0 + starving penalty (health<60) | 31% |
| Food control wt=1.5 + starving penalty (health<30) | 28% |
| Food control wt=1.0 (unconditional) | 51% (neutral) |
| Health-gated food (health<50, wt=2.0) | 51% (neutral) |
| Partition short-circuit (oppIdx=-1 at root) | 39% |

**Root cause — no game phase awareness:** Food control was applied with constant weight across all game phases. Early game, food is critical (need to grow to win h2h fights); mid/late game, territory dominance matters more. A flat food weight either helps early and hurts late, or vice versa — net neutral or worse.

**Root cause — transient partitions:** Body partitions open as tails retract. Setting `oppIdx=-1` at the root disables opponent modeling for the entire search, even at deeper nodes where the partition has opened. The snake then fails to prepare for re-engagement.

**Infrastructure shipped:** `VoronoiResult` struct (MyFood, OppFood, IsPartitioned) computed at zero extra cost. This is the foundation for game-phase eval — see roadmap.

**Future direction — game-phase eval (use VoronoiResult):**
- **Early game** (Length < 7 or Turn < ~30): boost wLen and food urgency, use `vr.MyFood` to prefer food-rich territory. Growing faster wins h2h fights.
- **Mid game** (current): territory-dominant eval already strong.
- **Late game / partitioned** (`vr.IsPartitioned`): space-filling efficiency — maximize territory utilization, seek food only for survival.
- Phase transitions should be gradual (linear interpolation) not abrupt thresholds.

- **Definition lookup:** `gopls definition <file.go>:#offset` — jump to declaration
- **Rename:** `gopls rename <file.go>:#offset NewName` — safe cross-file rename
- **Hover / signature:** `gopls hover <file.go>:#offset` — type info, doc strings
